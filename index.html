                    My Javascript class final project is an e-comerce site for a fake company known as everyday games.
                    People can log in and leave reviews on top of being able to build their cart and go through a simulated checkout.
                    This project utalizes additonal tools such as Firebase, Bootstrap, and Vue.js.

                    This is a basic react application that I completed in class.

                    This is the first game I developed in python as a personal project.
                    The project utalizes the library pygame and requires a keyboard in order to play.
